# My Favorite Movie

My favorite movie is **Red Notice (2021)**. **'Red Notice'** is a twist that completely recontextualizes the entire film, making every previous scene have a different meaning, Directed by **Rawson Marshall Thurber**.

## Plot Summary

Red Notice is about in the world of international crime, an Interpol agent attempts to hunt down and capture the world's most wanted art thief.
